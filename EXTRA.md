Extra Credit 1 (5 points): Add a "Help" menu to the menu bar. This menu should contain one menu item labeled "About" that displays an "About YOUR-NAME" stage (where YOUR-NAME is replaced with your name). The scene in this stage should contain an image of you as well as your name, email, and the version number for your application (version can be whatever you want). This stage should be application modal, and it should be closable so that the user can return to the main part of the application. If you are doing both of the extra credit requirements, then please make the "Help" menu the right-most menu

Extra Credit 2 (5 points): Add a "Theme" menu to the menu bar that lets the user switch between different stylings for the application. In order to receive points for this requirement, you should support at least two themes in addition to your application's default theme. HINT: You may want to explore having muliple CSS files for your application and loading/applying them as needed to facilitate this requirement. Please see the Useful Links appendix for reference material regarding styling.
